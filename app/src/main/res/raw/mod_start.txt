<h1>File Structure</h1>
<p>
Now that we have our project set up, we can make the structure for our mod.
There are many ways to structure the files, but we will follow Pahimar's and Minemaarten's example.
<br/>
These are the folders you will need to have, to start, they will all be in your src folder of your forge directory.
We will follow the formal naming convention for the folder structure. When making a project, it is proper to name your structure as:
</br>
COM.YOURNAME.YOURPROJECT
<br/>
So for me, I would name mine "com.taylar.tutorialMod".
<br/>
<h2>The basic folders</h2>
For a basic mod, you will need a few folders in this directory.
<br/>1. Make a new folder called "main".
<br/>2. Inside "main", make 2 folders "java" and "resources".
<br/>3. At this point, we diverge between the 2 folders. An illistration will show this best
<Button id=51, text=Show Image, type=show, onClick=52/>
<Image id=52, src=file_struc/>
<TextView id=30, fontSize=16/>

<h2>So what does this mean?</h2>
So why do we follow this file structure? This is the way that forge will look though your mod later on.
For our current understanding, these are the most important things to know.
<br/>The structure within the "java" folder is the same as the project name that we descibed earlier.
<br/>At the bottom of the java tree. This is where all of your java files and folders will be saved.
<br/>In the "resources" folder. This is where you will save all the assets for your mod, textures and language files.
