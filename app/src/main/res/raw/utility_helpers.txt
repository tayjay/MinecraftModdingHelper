<h1>What are they?</h1>
Utility and Helper classes are used to perform functions that are called by many parts of the mod.<br/>
Say you want to write an error message to the console, Forge Mod Loader has a function to do this,
 but it takes a lot of variables that you dont want to call each time you need to write a message. 
<br/><br/>That is why we have helper classes, they take a function and make it more easily accessible.<br/>
Here is an example Helper for working with the log file and console. Yo can find the code on Pahimar's tutorial.

<Button id=1, text=Show Code, type=show, onClick=51/>
<Image id=51, src=log_helper/>
