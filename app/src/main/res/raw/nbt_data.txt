<h1>NBT Data</h1>
Named Binary Tags are the way that Minecraft saves data to players, itemstacks, tile entities, the world, and other custom data.
NBT is stored in "Binary Pairs". When information is stored, the data is paired with a tag/name that you define. So if you have an integer to store coins, you would set an integer 
tag, give it the tag "coins", and store the int into it. Later you will be able to get the data with the tag you gave it.
<h1>Using NBT</h1>
Working with NBT can take up a lot of space in your methods, so we will make a helper class to store all of the functions we want to preform.
We will call it "NBTHelper.java". In our java source folder. Make a new folder inside called "util". Inside there make the NBTHelper.java file.
