<h1>NBT Data</h1>
Named Binary Tags are the way that Minecraft saves data to players, itemstacks, tile entities, the world, and other custom data.
NBT is stored in "Binary Pairs". When information is stored, the data is paired with a tag/name that you define. So if you have an integer to store coins, you would set an integer 
tag, give it the tag "coins", and store the int into it. Later you will be able to get the data with the tag you gave it.
<h1>Using NBT</h1>
Working with NBT can take up a lot of space in your methods, so we will make a helper class to store all of the functions we want to preform.
We will call it "NBTHelper.java". In our java source folder. Make a new folder inside called "util". Inside there make the NBTHelper.java file.

This is a text tutorial from Minecraft Forge on working with NBT data. As well as Pahimar's tutorial on the subject.

NBT will allow you to store many types of data: int,double,long,byte,boolean,float,String,ItemStack. Note that there is no way of storing arrays, more on that in "More on Helpers".<br/>
NBT is broken into NBT Tags and NBT Tag Compounds. An NBT Tag holds one value, while a NBT Tag Compound stores many NBT Tags together. When saving an NBT Tag you must save it to one that is already created,
or make a new one to store to.
<h1>Making a Tag</h1>
To create NBT Tags there you will have to work with the NBTTagCompound Class. the tags have their own methods to add data. But to simplify things,
